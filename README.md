A script that uses a python script that decifers a metadata file, finds the corresponding asset combinations a user wants for a specific 3D model design, 
the script then configures it in Blender on a server, using a FLASK API. The script then exports that 3D file, 
converts it into a ZIP file, uploads it on the server, and it gets downloaded by the user.
